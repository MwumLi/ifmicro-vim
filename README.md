## Intrdocuce

`ifmicro_vim` is a distribution of vim plugins and resources for Vim, mostly ubuntu

At present, I only write it for visiting ubuntu 14.04 by xshell, not test the effects for other platform  

So I can't sure that whether it take effects for you in working platform.

But you can try it, don't worry it will  make a bad influence for you.
